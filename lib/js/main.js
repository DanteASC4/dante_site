Let me tell you a little about myself...^250 \n \nSome of my passions are:\n- Coding, I really just fell in love with it, I can\'t stop learning new things \n- Video Games(League mostly) \n- Fun coding projects(I made a python script to send people a few hundred emails\n  and maybe ~50 texts) \n \n \nI grew up for a few years in Long Island, then when I turned 6 me and my mom moved to the city. At a young age technology quickly became a part of my life. I got a silver ps2 in 2nd or 3rd grade. I played it a ridiculous amount, since then I have only dived deeper into the world of technology. I intend to continue to do so, now not just through use of it but production as well. I will hone my skills in coding for much of the rest of my life!\n\nSome of my traits:\n- I can befriend anyone who is not really mean \n \nIf you are interested, here is my contact info: \nEmail Zexovon@gmail.com"],
